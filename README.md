Practicing pulling from git repo

``` zsh
git clone "name of repo"
```
The above command lets you connect to a repository on github on your terminal

``` zsh
git status
```
The above command lets you check the status of your branch,
it lets you know if anything  is  staged  and ready to be commited to remote  repository
